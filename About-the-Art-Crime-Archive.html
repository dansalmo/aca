The Art|Crime Archive is a web-based platform devoted to the study of the spaces where art and crime overlap as ‘criminal art’ and ‘creative crime’.  Users can post and comment on visual, audio, and text artifacts that illuminate the cultural similarities between transgressive art and criminal behaviors.  The goal is to encourage a dialectical interpretation of art, culture, and crime.  The work product is a dynamic archive which can be configured and re-configured for a multiplicity of contexts—art exhibitions, academic presentations, community awareness panels, etc.

The ACA, housed in SDSU’s <a href="http://ipua.sdsu.edu/">Institute for Public and Urban Affairs (IPUA)</a>, is organized by an artist <a href="http://ipua.sdsu.edu/docs/bg_cv_2012.pdf">(Brian Goeltzenleuchter)</a>, a criminologist <a href="http://spa.sdsu.edu/web/index.php/bios/paul_kaplan">(Paul Kaplan)</a>, and computer engineer <a href="http://ipua.sdsu.edu/docs/ResumeDanSalmonsen_SDSU.pdf">(DanSalmonsen)</a>.</pre>
