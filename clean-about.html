<p><b>The Art/Crime
Archive: A Place for Reactions to Boredom</b></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Brian
Goeltzenleuchter, Paul Kaplan, and Dan Salmonsen</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Art Crime Archive (ACA) is a collaborative laboratory,
teaching center, and web-based platform devoted to the study of the shadow
space where art and crime overlap.  The ACA, housed in SDSU’s Institute for
Public and Urban Affairs (IPUA), is organized by an artist (Brian
Goeltzenleuchter), a criminologist (Paul Kaplan), and computer engineer (Dan
Salmonsen).  The Archive’s method involves locating, archiving, and studying
visual, audio, and text artifacts that illuminate the cultural similarities
between transgressive art and criminal behaviors.   Put another way, The ACA
investigates ‘criminal art’ and ‘creative crime.’ The work product is a dynamic
archive which can be configured and re-configured for a multiplicity of
contexts—art exhibitions, academic presentations, community awareness panels,
etc. Ultimately, the Archive aims to foment a dialectical interpretation of art
and crime.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ACA invites submissions of ‘criminal art’ and/or
‘creative crime’ to its web-based platform:  artcrimearchive.org.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> 
Users can easily upload art/crime images, video, text, and sound to the
website.  Users can then comment on their own and other submissions, and also
rate submissions on scales of ‘artistry’ and/or ‘criminality.’  Submissions can
be nominated for permanent inclusion in the ACA by registered users; these
submissions can then be evaluated by ACA Fellows (explained below) or
Directors.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>These data enable a range of analytic and socio-aesthetic
outcomes, such as:</p>

<p>·        
Peer-reviewed journal articles focused on ‘case studies’ of
particular art/crime artifacts submitted to the ACA</p>

<p>·        
Peer-reviewed journal articles addressing this post-structural,
new media archive as a dynamic agent (as opposed to a passive object)</p>

<p>·        
Peer-reviewed journal articles about categories of artifacts
(e.g., comparing ACA user ratings of graffiti to tattoos—analyzing perceptions
of ‘criminality’ or ‘artistry’)</p>

<p>·        
Peer-reviewed journal articles based on the use of cutting edge
image visualization software to explore patterns in archived images</p>

<p>·        
Books co-authored by the Directors and/or Fellows (e.g., an
edited volume focusing on projects developed by Fellows using ACA data)</p>

<p>·        
Critical engagements with more explicitly policy oriented
artifacts in the ACA (e.g., a panel discussion of the creativity of ‘gang
monikers’ listed in gang injunction documents, to include a scholar of gangs, a
gang member, and a poet)</p>

<p>·        
Exhibitions curated from archival documents (e.g., “Criminal Art
& Creative Crime: Cultural Perceptions of Transgression” is a curatorial
project currently in development by Goeltzenleuchter)</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Fellows</i></p>

<p>A key feature of the ACA is its community of Fellows. 
Fellows are appointed by the Directors and come from a diversity of
backgrounds, including professional academics, artists, students, justice
system professionals, activists, and reformed criminals. A key role for Fellows
will be to evaluate nominated uploads to the web platform for inclusion in the
Archive. Ultimately, we envision Fellows as both data providers and data
analysts; all Fellows have access to all Archive materials, metadata, and
analytics for their own scholarly, creative, or other relevant works.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Theoretical Significance</i></p>

<p>Some post-structural theorists argue that Modernity is
‘boring’ because it objectifies human subjects with typologies, organizations,
laws, bureaucracies, and categories—its ‘boxes.’  At the same time, we are
perpetually invited from one box to the other—tricked into thinking we are
having a subjective moment, usually through the act of consuming. Arguably, all
of modernity’s boxes possess a certain ‘house of cards’ aspect that most of us
don’t perceive directly but vaguely intuit.  Hence the idea of ‘postmodern
malaise.’<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
Sometimes the malaise translates into action, from the tiniest
‘microresistance’ of tagging a wall to the extreme of killing people with mail
bombs.  In a sense, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Ted Kazcynski were both reacting
to boredom.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Branches of thought and discourse about art and crime run
parallel. An important school in contemporary art theory argues that ‘the
post-modern flux’ means that art should be ‘relational:’ “open-ended,
interactive, and resistant to closure” (Bishop, 2004, p. 52). Moreover, because
a truly democratic society requires <i>conflict</i>,art should cause <i>unease,
discomfort, and tension</i> (Bishop, 2004, p. 66).  <i> </i>Like crime, art
should be transgressive, disruptive, or deviant (but also relationally
seductive and pleasurable).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> 
Similarly, since (at least) the emergence of cultural criminology with Katz’s
(1988) transformative <i>Seductions of Crime</i>, a school of scholars of
deviance, crime and culture have articulated how crime is interactive
(relational), improvised, emotional, and related to conflict. Like art, crime
can be frightening and dangerous, but also commodified, consumed, and
exploited.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a><a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>An important distinction is that art’s dangers are usually
celebrated while crime’s dangers are condemned; this is because we conflate crime
that harms with crime that offends, but does not harm.  Sometimes these
contexts overlap or drift between categories.  ‘Coke rap,’ for example,
illuminates the shadow space where art and crime live together.  Is the Wu Tang
Clan a crime syndicate or one of the greatest rap groups in history? Is
graffiti synonymous with urban blight and vandalism?  Or is it “street art”
worthy of museum exhibitions and elite private art collections?  The ACA
investigates these and other responses to boredom.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>At first glance, the Art/Crime Archive might seem to
represent the epitome of the modern.  By collecting, assessing, organizing and
preserving, an archive literally and figuratively ‘boxes’ its subject. This
project, however, transforms the traditional understanding of ‘archiving’ by
using digital media to make it interactive and dynamic.  In the first place,
each individual engagement with the Archive can be unique because of the
dynamic nature of the web platform, which allows individual users to uniquely
configure their experience in the way material is captured, retrieved,
assembled and shared.  Secondly, the integration of dynamic media platforms
‘democratizes’ the archive, offering access to a far greater audience using the
vernacular of social media. In this way the ACA is designed to remember the
past while anticipating public opinion on the future. Ideally, the ACA assumes
the role of a collective memory: it becomes a collective instantiation of a
community’s opinion about the in-flux limits of cultural transgression (or
antagonism).</p>

<p><i> </i></p>

<p><i>Note on Harm</i></p>

<p>We are aware that this project could be interpreted as
insensitive to the harms caused by crime.  We do not wish to minimize the pain,
suffering, and loss caused in victims by the behaviors of some persons deemed
criminal.  Rather, an important part of our project is to illuminate the
relevance of culture to criminal behavior in order to better understand
processes of criminalization, labeling, and selective law enforcement. 
Ultimately, we believe that this illuminative process will lead to deeper
understandings of ‘causes’ of crime, which can in turn inform policy decisions
aimed at decreasing harm.  We hasten to add that lots of things not called
crime are more harmful to individuals and communities than almost any particular
violent crime, or even large scale patterns of violent crime (e.g., the use of
tobacco, environmental disasters, risky financial schemes).  This archive can
help study why certain relatively un-harmful acts are deemed criminal while
some extremely harmful acts are not.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Note on Invisible Resistance</i></p>

<p>We know that some artists and criminals do their work
explicitly to destabilize America’s boring western liberal democratic
consumerist world of blah.  An old acquaintance the Archive’s was a mid-level seller
of methamphetamine in the late 1990s in San Francisco.  This person framed his
work as <i>explicitly</i> subversive, and purposely invisible—not-to-be
exposed.  This drug dealer wanted his work to be invisible not primarily because
of risk of arrest but because he wanted to do be deeply <i>underground</i> as a
way of resisting what he perceived to be America’s boring, conformist,
consumerist society.  We reflect on this position with some difficulty as we
develop this project.  We do not want to illuminate or expose cultural
practices that inherently require invisibility.  At the same time, we find
these practices profoundly interesting.  For now, we can’t resolve this issue
and simply propose to keep it in the conversation.</p>

The web platform will be engineered so that only registered users can upload. 
In order to register, users will be required to electronically agree to terms
of use to include a provision prohibiting uploads of evidence of prosecutable
criminal behavior.  Users will also be required provide identifying
information, including the IP address of the submitting computer.</p>
